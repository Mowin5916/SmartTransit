# 🚍 SmartTransit – Intelligent Public Transportation System

SmartTransit is a full-stack intelligent public transportation system designed to improve urban mobility using data-driven and machine-learning-based insights. The project combines backend services, a modern web interface, a mobile application, and machine learning models to support smarter transit planning and analysis.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Urban public transportation systems often suffer from inefficient route planning, unpredictable passenger demand, and traffic-related delays. Traditional systems lack intelligent decision support and data-driven forecasting.  
SmartTransit aims to solve these challenges by applying machine learning and modern software technologies to public transit data.
